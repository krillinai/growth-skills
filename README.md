> Created and maintained by [KrillinAI](https://github.com/KrillinAI), an AI team focused on content intelligence and global growth. [Growth Playbook](https://github.com/krillinai/growth-playbook) is the open-source knowledge companion to Growth & Marketing Skills, providing the frameworks, cases, and methods that these reusable AI execution capabilities put into practice.

**[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)**

An open collection of reusable skills for growth and marketing work. Growth & Marketing Skills helps practitioners and AI agents turn marketing knowledge into repeatable workflows across the entire growth lifecycle.

## What It Covers

- **Content creation** - Research, ideation, writing, editing, and content distribution.
- **Data insights** - Measurement, analysis, experimentation, and decision support.
- **Advertising** - Campaign planning, creative strategy, account audits, measurement, and optimization recommendations.
- **Acquisition and conversion** - Audience development, lead generation, activation, and conversion improvement.
- **Marketing strategy** - Positioning, go-to-market planning, campaign design, and growth planning.

## Install and use

Each directory under `skills/` is a standalone Agent Skill. Install only the Skills needed for the current job so selection stays clear and context remains focused.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krillinai/growth-skills.git
mkdir -p "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills"
cp -R growth-skills/skills/growth-diagnosis "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/"
```

Invoke an installed Skill explicitly when the task could match several capabilities:

```text
Use $growth-diagnosis to identify our primary growth constraint and route the next analysis.
```

For another Agent Skills-compatible client, copy or link the selected `skills/<name>/` directory into that client's Skill directory.

## The Growth Lifecycle

The collection is designed to support connected workflows from first contact to compounding growth:

**Discover → Acquire → Activate → Convert → Retain → Expand**

## Growing the Collection

This repository is at an early stage. New skills will be added as practical, reusable workflows are developed and validated.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. A useful skill should address a clear growth or marketing problem, provide an actionable workflow, and produce outcomes that can be evaluated. Contribution guidelines and skill conventions will evolve with the collection.
