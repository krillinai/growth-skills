# Economics, Risk, And Decision Gates

## Build The Resource And Cost Ledger

Include relevant incremental resources and effects:

- research, product, engineering, design, data, analytics, creative, sales, marketing, partner, legal or regulatory review, security, privacy, finance, procurement, implementation, migration, training, support, success, moderation, fulfillment, and leadership time;
- software, vendors, platforms, media, incentives, commissions, payment, infrastructure, model inference, storage, data, devices, inventory, facilities, insurance, and professional services;
- one-time, recurring, fixed, variable, step, marginal, committed, avoidable, recoverable, sunk, allocated, shared, opportunity, decommissioning, exit, and residual costs;
- working capital, billing, collection, refunds, chargebacks, taxes, credits, currency, inflation, and cash timing where relevant.

Do not treat an allocated cost as avoidable without evidence or omit a real shared-capacity constraint because it is already in a budget. Keep accounting, contribution, and cash views separate and reconcile them.

## Model Time And Capacity

Record ramp, implementation delay, adoption, utilization, maturity, seasonality, renewal, useful life, degradation, replacement, decommissioning, and terminal or exit timing. Connect expected volume and complexity to product, engineering, data, sales, support, success, fulfillment, moderation, security, finance, procurement, partner, and leadership capacity.

Capacity can be a hard gate even when financial returns look positive. Show where the investment displaces core obligations, maintenance, reliability, trust, compliance, or another portfolio bet. Route detailed unit economics to `unit-economics-analysis`, lifetime value to `ltv-analysis`, infrastructure readiness to `growth-infrastructure-assessment`, and staffing or decision rights to `growth-organization-design`.

## Use Scenarios And Sensitivity

Separate observed baseline, estimate, target, scenario, forecast, benchmark, and causal estimate. Build scenarios only for coherent states that change a decision. Define assumptions, source, range, lag, maturity, economics, capacity, risk, trigger, and response.

Do not invent probabilities or average scenarios into an expected value. Use probability-weighted values only when a separately valid forecasting or risk process supplies calibrated probabilities. Route time-series outlooks and calibration to `growth-forecasting`.

Use sensitivity to expose decision boundaries, not to create a decorative tornado chart. Test material uncertain inputs such as eligible demand, conversion, repeated value, retention, realized price, marginal cost, delivery cost, implementation time, capacity, useful life, discount basis, and exit value. State the threshold at which the recommendation changes and whether that threshold is plausible from evidence.

## Keep Risks Distinct

Maintain separate risk rows for customer harm, accessibility, fairness, trust, privacy, security, safety, fraud, abuse, regulatory or legal review, contractual obligations, product quality, reliability, operations, people, partner, platform, concentration, supply, reputation, financial, cash, model, measurement, execution, and opportunity cost where applicable.

For each risk record affected population, trigger, exposure, severity, duration, reversibility, evidence, uncertainty, prevention, mitigation, owner, monitoring, escalation, stop, rollback, residual risk, and specialist review. Do not average noncompensable harms with financial upside or invent probability-impact scores. A risk matrix organizes discussion; it does not authorize a decision.

## Design A Bounded Pilot

A pilot must have:

- one named decision and critical uncertainty;
- bounded customer, product, market, channel, system, cost, duration, and exposure;
- baseline or credible alternative evidence;
- prerequisites, permissions, owners, and capacity;
- leading customer value, retained outcome, economics, and guardrail contracts;
- positive, negative, harmful, and inconclusive outcomes;
- maturity date, decision rule, cap, stop, correction, rollback, expiry, and residual obligations.

Do not call an irreversible rollout, full-market launch, annual program, or total budget a pilot. A pilot is useful only when its evidence can change the next commitment.

## Apply Decision Gates

Use gates in dependency order:

1. **contract:** one decision, owner, baseline, options, scope, horizon, and cutoff;
2. **strategic fit:** compatible selected strategy and explicit exclusions;
3. **customer value:** evidence for a bounded problem, value, repeated outcome, and harm protections;
4. **mechanism:** credible link from intervention to incremental outcome with alternatives visible;
5. **feasibility:** product, data, delivery, support, security, compliance, partner, and organization readiness;
6. **economics and cash:** compatible incremental value, cost, contribution, funding, timing, capacity, and downside;
7. **risk and reversibility:** controls, residual risk, escalation, stop, rollback, and exit;
8. **governance:** approvers, decision rights, measurement, review, refresh, audit, and external-action controls.

Use `verified ready`, `bounded pilot only`, `specified not verified`, `verified blocker`, `unavailable`, or `not applicable` for each gate. Do not average gates into a readiness score. Name the first decision-limiting gate, contradictions, and the smallest evidence or capability that can change it.

Map the gates to `approve`, `bounded pilot`, `preserve option`, `defer`, `reject`, or `unresolved` under [investment-case-contract.md](investment-case-contract.md). The recommendation expires when a critical input, price, cost, market, product, regulation, capacity, or strategy version changes.
