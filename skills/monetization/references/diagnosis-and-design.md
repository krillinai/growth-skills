# Monetization Diagnosis And Design

## Diagnostic Sequence

1. Verify participant roles, value, commercial terms, metric definitions, reconciliation, and cohort maturity.
2. Check activation and retained customer value before interpreting price or checkout.
3. Locate the largest decision-relevant loss, delay, cost, contraction, exception, trust issue, or payer objection.
4. Compare segment, offer, package, price metric, price level, terms, sales motion, payment, retention, expansion, and cost evidence.
5. Separate observed facts, reported signals, inferred mechanisms, and unavailable evidence.
6. Select one mechanism only when it changes the next decision.

Useful mechanism categories include weak or unproven customer value, user-buyer-payer misalignment, poor value proof, wrong segment, package complexity or missing capability, harmful limit, weak upgrade trigger, unsuitable price metric, price or contract mismatch, premature or late paywall, trial-length mismatch, checkout or payment failure, procurement or security friction, discount dependence, exception-heavy sales, involuntary churn, weak renewal value, cost-to-serve growth, margin leakage, and measurement error. Categories may coexist; do not assign one without evidence.

## Willingness To Pay

Use attributable customer interviews, alternatives and budget evidence, purchase history, sales conversations, offer tests, trade-off research, or bounded market tests. Treat stated willingness, Van Westendorp, and preference research as directional until reconciled with purchase, retained use, renewal, expansion, discount behavior, and observed budget decisions.

Do not turn a small or biased interview sample into a price forecast. Keep willingness to pay separate from ability to pay, procurement authority, perceived risk, and product eligibility.

## Offer, Package, And Revenue Model

Define core value, segment differentiators, limits, proof before upgrade, upgrade trigger, downgrade path, service level, and migration rule. Avoid creating a package for every observed segment.

Evaluate price metrics against value correlation, measurability, predictability, expansion, cost alignment, incentives, fairness, and operability. Choose subscription, usage, seat, transaction, advertising, licensing, outcome, or hybrid models from customer value, frequency, buying behavior, cost structure, attribution, and risk allocation rather than category fashion.

For free, trial, freemium, sandbox, or paid pilot designs, define time to value, natural frequency, qualified exposure, serving cost, distribution contribution, upgrade reason, retained free value, paid retention, and exit or fallback experience. Free access is not healthy when it creates cost without customer value, distribution, learning, or credible upgrade.

For AI products, connect price to successful task or workflow value rather than token activity alone. Include model and tool cost, retries, human review, latency, failure, support, privacy, trust, budget predictability, vendor dependency, and margin sensitivity.

## Commercial Design Record

Every design must state:

- supported mechanism and evidence;
- eligible segment and user, buyer, approver, and payer roles;
- customer value and credible alternative;
- offer, package, entitlements, limits, metric, price, currency, contract, and service terms;
- qualified exposure, conversion event, maturation, renewal, and follow-up windows;
- activation, retained use, realized price, revenue, margin, refund, contraction, expansion, and renewal outcomes;
- trust, fairness, migration, support, accessibility, privacy, compliance, sales-conflict, and customer-harm guardrails;
- randomization unit or alternative evidence design;
- owner, approvals, rollback rule, and follow-up action;
- dependencies and external-action authorization still required.

Short-term paid conversion is not sufficient. Preserve original exposure, terms, and cohort through retained-use, margin, renewal, and migration readouts. Do not run a price test where treatment cannot be applied ethically, consistently, or operationally.

## Governance And Handoffs

Name owners and approval boundaries for offers, list price, discounts, contracts, credits, migration, metering, billing, taxes, payments, refunds, disputes, measurement, and review. A design artifact is not permission to change any of them.

Prioritize by decision relevance, evidence strength, eligible economic exposure, mechanism control, learning value, time to mature, reversibility, trust and fairness risk, operational burden, cash impact, and downside. These are judgment dimensions, not an invented numeric score.

Route broad cross-lifecycle constraint selection to `growth-diagnosis`; first-value and paywall timing analysis to `activation`; recurring value, churn, GRR, NRR, or expansion quality to `retention`; page and offer copy to `copywriting`; lifecycle messages to `lifecycle-marketing`; one-to-one sales outreach to `b2b-outbound-messaging`; and causal design to an experiment capability. A handoff is not authorization to access accounts or change commercial state.
