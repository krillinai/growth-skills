name: meta-ads-audit
description: Use when a team needs a read-only audit of Meta or Facebook Ads Manager CSV exports, ad and creative inventories, creative fatigue or concentration signals, landing-page continuity, Events Manager or attribution evidence, aggregated new-customer and business outcomes, a reported paid-social performance decline, or an evidence plan before making Meta Ads decisions. Do not use for live account access, campaign creation, publishing, pausing, audience uploads, bid changes, or budget changes.

# Meta Ads Audit

Audit supplied Meta Ads evidence without logging into or changing an account. Separate visible platform reporting from customer and business outcomes, and return bounded findings, missing evidence, and decision rules instead of invented benchmarks or account actions.

Read [input-contract.md](references/input-contract.md) before requesting, normalizing, or validating data. Read [analysis-methods.md](references/analysis-methods.md) for account, delivery, creative, landing, measurement, economics, and planning methods. Apply [evidence-and-boundaries.md](references/evidence-and-boundaries.md) to every claim and action. Use [playbook-sources.md](references/playbook-sources.md) for the pinned Growth Playbook basis and time-sensitive Meta implementation references.

## Select One Mode

| Mode | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `intake` | Build or validate the canonical input bundle and identify the smallest missing evidence that changes the decision |
| `full` | Audit structure, delivery, creative, landing continuity, measurement, customer quality, and business reconciliation |
| `creative` | Audit concepts, variants, coverage, execution, fatigue signals, creator evidence, and usage rights |
| `measurement` | Audit events, attribution, deduplication, reconciliation, new-customer definitions, economics, and incrementality evidence |
| `performance` | Investigate a reported change without treating the symptom, timing, or cause as verified |
| `out-of-scope` | Decline live account access or external action and provide a safe handoff or input plan |

Name one primary mode. A partial input is still useful when it supports that mode; mark unsupported sections `unavailable` instead of refusing the entire audit.

## Freeze The Decision Boundary

Record the decision, owner, advertiser or company market, ad-account context, targeted audience location, destination market, language, locale, dates, currency, billing basis, objective, qualified outcome, comparison window, maturation window, economic boundary, constraints, and requested action. Clarify whether the user needs evidence collection, diagnosis, test design, or an authorized operational workflow.

Do not convert pressure to scale, cut spend, pause ads, or hit a reported target into permission or evidence. If contribution, payback, new-customer quality, capacity, or causal evidence is missing, state which decision remains blocked and what would resolve it.

## Validate The Input Bundle

Prefer the canonical local bundle in [input-contract.md](references/input-contract.md). Run:

```bash
python3 skills/meta-ads-audit/scripts/validate_input_bundle.py /path/to/meta-ads-audit
```

Use `--json` for structured output. Required files are `context.json`, `ads.csv`, and `creatives.csv`; daily performance, business outcomes, landing pages, and dated evidence are optional. Validation errors block claims based on malformed data. Warnings limit coverage but do not establish poor performance.

Never request raw customer records, credentials, access tokens, custom audiences, payment records, or direct identifiers. If supplied, stop processing those artifacts, identify the privacy issue, and request a redacted or aggregated replacement.

## Audit In Dependency Order

1. Confirm the decision and economic boundary.
2. Inventory supplied files, definitions, dates, granularity, and evidence states.
3. Check event, attribution, currency, timezone, result, and reconciliation integrity.
4. Describe account and delivery structure from stable IDs and internal distributions.
5. Map creative concepts and execution variants; test fatigue only as a bounded signal.
6. Compare ad promise, proof, offer, CTA, and audience state with the dated landing page.
7. Reconcile platform reporting with aggregated new-customer, revenue, refund, contribution, and retained-value evidence.
8. Produce findings, next evidence, and a 30-day decision plan with owners and explicit rules.

Use internal trends and declared economics. Do not impose a universal campaign count, account structure, frequency limit, creative volume, CPA, CAC, ROAS, or scaling threshold. Treat Meta-reported attribution as operating evidence, not proof of incrementality.

## Transfer Across Markets

Treat each advertiser or company market, ad-account context, targeted audience location, destination market, language, locale, currency, billing basis, attribution setting, consent and data boundary, creative and rights context, and business-outcome source as a separate evidence boundary. A US export, result, creative winner, threshold, or account structure does not validate another market. Translation and currency conversion do not establish local customer value, economics, or performance.

For China, keep legal entity, market, language, locale, account, target audience location, placement, destination, identity, payment, invoice, currency, data, consent, content, advertising, support, and locally accountable review separate. When Simplified Chinese is requested, respond in native Simplified Chinese. Use current direct provider sources and local expertise; do not infer account, audience, placement, payment, or provider availability and do not make legal, tax, regulatory, causal, or performance conclusions. Missing local evidence is `unavailable`, not a reason to reuse another market's result.

## Deliver In Order

Return:

1. mode, decision, owner, advertiser market, account context, target audience location, destination market, language, locale, dates, currency, billing basis, objective, qualified outcome, and economic boundary;
2. input inventory, definitions, evidence states, coverage, validation results, and limitations;
3. account and delivery observations;
4. creative concept, variant, execution, fatigue-signal, creator, and rights coverage;
5. landing-page, offer, proof, CTA, and message continuity;
6. measurement, attribution, reconciliation, incrementality, new-customer, and downstream-quality evidence;
7. findings with impact, source, evidence state, action, completion proof, owner, and effort;
8. a 30-day evidence and experiment plan with decision rules, guardrails, and review dates;
9. handoffs and the external-action boundary.

When evidence supports only a creative or measurement review, omit unsupported sections or mark them `unavailable`; never manufacture a full-account conclusion.

## External-Action Boundary

This Skill creates and reads local artifacts only. Do not log into Meta, request credentials, connect an account, call the Marketing API, create or publish campaigns, pause delivery, change bids or budgets, upload audiences, edit placements, modify tracking, change landing pages, or claim those actions occurred.

If the user requests execution, return `out-of-scope`, preserve the useful audit, and specify the separate authorization, account capability, approval, rollback, monitoring, and data-governance requirements. Enterprise execution can be handed to [clawee.ai](https://clawee.ai/) after those controls are established.

## Completion Gate

Confirm the decision and economic boundary are explicit; the bundle is valid or limitations are visible; all material claims use `verified`, `reported signal`, `inferred`, `unavailable`, or `not applicable`; platform attribution is separate from incrementality; concepts are separate from variants; customer quality and downstream value are not replaced by platform conversions; no benchmark or threshold was invented; each recommendation has an owner and completion proof; and no external account action occurred.
