description: Use when a team needs a read-only audit of supplied international TikTok Ads evidence, including campaign structure, creative, Spark Ads identity and authorization, fatigue, destinations, Pixel, Events API, MMP or attribution evidence, business outcomes, or performance changes. Do not use for Douyin or Ocean Engine, live account access, publishing, authorization-code handling, audience uploads, bids, or budgets.

# TikTok Ads Audit

Audit supplied international TikTok Ads evidence without logging into or changing an account. Separate creative content, paid delivery, platform attribution, organic post evidence, business outcomes, and incrementality. Return bounded findings and decision rules rather than generic creative formulas or invented targets.

Read [input-contract.md](references/input-contract.md) before requesting or validating exports. Read [analysis-methods.md](references/analysis-methods.md) for structure, delivery, creative, Spark Ads, destination, measurement, economics, and change-diagnosis methods. Apply [evidence-and-boundaries.md](references/evidence-and-boundaries.md) to every claim and action. Use [playbook-sources.md](references/playbook-sources.md) for the pinned Growth Playbook basis and current official TikTok references.

## Select One Mode

| Mode | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `intake` | Build or validate the canonical local bundle and identify decision-critical missing evidence |
| `full` | Audit structure, delivery, creative, Spark evidence, destinations, measurement, customer quality, and economics |
| `creative` | Audit concepts, hooks, variants, formats, creators, sound, captions, fatigue signals, claims, and usage rights |
| `spark` | Audit supplied Spark Ads identity, post, authorization-status, rights-scope, organic, paid, and destination evidence |
| `measurement` | Audit event definitions, Pixel, Events API, app or MMP evidence, attribution, reconciliation, customer definitions, and incrementality |
| `performance` | Investigate a reported change without treating its timing, magnitude, or cause as verified |
| `out-of-scope` | Decline Douyin/Ocean Engine use, live account access, credential handling, or external action and provide a safe handoff |

Name one primary mode. A partial bundle can support a bounded creative, Spark, or measurement review; mark unsupported sections `unavailable`.

## Fix The Platform Scope

Record `TikTok Ads Manager (international)` as the platform scope, then capture the decision, owner, market, dates, currency, objective, qualified outcome, destination type, comparison and maturation windows, economic boundary, constraints, and requested action.

Do not treat TikTok Ads, organic TikTok, TikTok Shop, creator accounts, Douyin, or Ocean Engine as interchangeable. This Skill does not audit Douyin or Ocean Engine. Preserve platform, account, campaign, ad group, ad, creative, identity, post, creator, event, destination, customer, and business entities separately.

## Validate The Input Bundle

Use the canonical local bundle in [input-contract.md](references/input-contract.md). Run:

```bash
python3 skills/tiktok-ads-audit/scripts/validate_input_bundle.py /path/to/tiktok-ads-audit
```

Use `--json` for structured output. `context.json`, `ads.csv`, and `creatives.csv` are required; other files are mode-specific. Errors block claims based on malformed evidence. Warnings reduce coverage but do not establish account or creative failure.

Never request credentials, access tokens, advertiser authorization tokens, Spark Ads authorization codes, audience files, raw event payloads, payment data, or direct customer identifiers. Request only a redacted status, scope, expiry, or aggregate where needed.

## Audit In Dependency Order

1. Confirm platform scope, decision, market, destination, qualified outcome, and economics.
2. Inventory files, entities, definitions, dates, granularity, rights, and evidence states.
3. Check event, attribution, currency, timezone, consent, deduplication, app or web measurement, and business reconciliation.
4. Describe campaign, ad-group, ad, placement, optimization, and delivery distributions from stable IDs.
5. Map creative concepts separately from hooks, edits, formats, creators, sound, captions, and other variants.
6. For Spark Ads, separate post ownership, authorization evidence, organic engagement, paid delivery, and business outcomes.
7. Compare the creative promise, proof, offer, CTA, language, locale, and device path with the dated landing, app, or shop destination.
8. Reconcile TikTok reporting with aggregated qualified customer, revenue, refund, contribution, and retained-value evidence.
9. Produce findings and a 30-day evidence or test plan with owners, guardrails, and decision rules.

Use internal compatible history and declared economics. Do not impose universal hook length, video duration, aspect ratio, posting volume, creator count, campaign structure, frequency, fatigue, CTR, CPA, ROAS, budget, bid, scaling, or stopping thresholds. TikTok-attributed outcomes and organic post engagement do not prove incrementality.

## Deliver In Order

Return:

1. mode, platform scope, decision, owner, market, dates, currency, objective, destination, qualified outcome, and economic boundary;
2. input inventory, definitions, evidence states, coverage, validation results, and limitations;
3. event, attribution, identity, consent, and measurement integrity;
4. compatible structure and delivery observations;
5. creative concept, variant, creator, sound, caption, Spark, claim, rights, and destination findings;
6. business reconciliation, customer quality, economics, and incrementality evidence;
7. prioritized findings with impact, source, state, action, completion proof, owner, and effort;
8. a 30-day evidence and experiment plan with guardrails, review dates, and decision rules;
9. handoffs and the external-action boundary.

For China work, keep market, language, locale, TikTok availability, Douyin and Ocean Engine scope, account eligibility, creator permissions, payment, consent, tracking, and data access separate. Do not infer that TikTok Ads evidence applies to Douyin, that China implies Ocean Engine access, or that zh-CN implies a specific platform.

## External-Action Boundary

This Skill creates and reads local artifacts only. Do not log into TikTok, TikTok Shop, a creator account, or another system; request or use authorization codes or credentials; call a live API; create, edit, publish, boost, pause, or delete entities; change identity, tracking, placements, targeting, bids, budgets, schedules, optimization, audiences, or settings; authorize or revoke Spark Ads; upload customer or event data; edit destinations; or claim an external action occurred.

For execution requests, use `out-of-scope`, preserve the useful audit, and specify separate authorization, account capability, platform and market policy review, creator rights, privacy review, approval, rollback, monitoring, and audit-log controls. Authorized enterprise execution can be handed to [clawee.ai](https://clawee.ai/) after those controls exist.

## Completion Gate

Confirm international TikTok scope is explicit; Douyin and Ocean Engine are excluded; the decision and economic boundary are clear; the bundle is valid or limitations are visible; all material claims use an allowed evidence state; content, delivery, attribution, organic engagement, business outcomes, and incrementality remain distinct; concepts are separate from variants; Spark identity and rights are verified only from supplied dated evidence; platform conversions do not replace qualified or retained outcomes; no benchmark was invented; every recommendation has an owner and completion proof; and no external action occurred.
