# SEO Audit

Diagnose from inspectable evidence; separate observations, hypotheses, and missing inputs.

## Intake

Use known context. Establish the business outcome, target market, affected scope, recent changes, and available first-party data; ask only about consequential gaps.

## Set Scope

Choose the smallest sufficient mode:

- **focused**: one symptom, template, URL set, or question.
- **page**: one page and its search purpose.
- **site**: property patterns with an explicit inventory or sample.
- **incident**: a sudden loss, migration, release regression, or indexing emergency.

Never inflate a focused request. Use [audit-playbooks.md](references/audit-playbooks.md) for modes, stopping rules, and site-type routing.

## Inventory Capabilities

Record available and absent capabilities: rendered browser, raw HTTP, shell/files, lab or field performance, first-party analytics/search/index/log data, and backlink or private market data. Never imply access or rendering not performed.

## Evidence Contract

Label every result:

- **verified**: directly observed in an inspectable artifact.
- **inferred**: supported indirectly; name the check needed to confirm it.
- **unavailable**: required evidence or capability was not accessible.

Unavailable evidence is a limitation, never a negative finding. Set impact and confidence to **not-assessed**, state its consequence, and request the smallest useful input.

Use [evidence-and-prioritization.md](references/evidence-and-prioritization.md) for rating and ordering rules. Each record has: title, status, evidence, impact, confidence, action, completion condition, and effort.

## Operate Safely

Default checks to bounded, read-only access. Require explicit authorization for authenticated/private access, high-volume crawling, broad automated requests, or tests that could affect service. Never bypass access controls; honor agreed rate and concurrency limits. Minimize or redact credentials, tokens, cookies, personal data, private paths, and sensitive exports in reports. Follow the playbook stopping rules.

## Diagnose in Dependency Order

1. Discovery, crawling, and indexability.
2. Canonical behavior and site integrity, including redirects and variants.
3. Performance and mobile behavior.
4. Relevance and search intent.
5. Content quality and internal discovery.
6. Authority and market signals, only when supporting evidence exists.

Downstream polish cannot outrank an upstream blocker. Consult [source-notes.md](references/source-notes.md) for factual search-engine or platform rules, and expose relevant sources in the report.

## Handle Markets And China

Treat each search provider, product or surface, property and canonical domain, market, language, locale, device context, capture date, inventory or sample, and private data source as a separate evidence boundary. A crawl, index state, ranking, webmaster export, traffic diagnosis, rule, or recommendation from one boundary does not validate another. Translation does not preserve search demand, intent, indexing, ranking, or performance evidence.

For China, keep market, legal entity, language, locale, property, provider, product, domain, app or web surface, crawling, rendering, indexing, webmaster data, structured data, content, advertising, data access, and locally accountable review separate. When Simplified Chinese is requested, respond in native Simplified Chinese. Use current direct official sources for provider-specific rules or mark them `unavailable`; do not transfer Google or Bing behavior to Baidu or another provider, infer provider availability, or make legal, regulatory, causal, ranking, traffic, or performance conclusions. Missing local or provider evidence is a limitation, not a negative finding.

## Report

Default report: scope, available and unavailable evidence/capabilities, executive assessment, priority findings, grouped findings, a dependency-sequenced action plan, and limitations. Keep claims within the inspected sample.

Create HTML only when requested; follow [html-report.md](references/html-report.md). Do not promise visual verification unless a suitable viewing capability is available and used.

## Boundaries

A request solely to implement structured data or another SEO change is not an audit. Clarify the desired deliverable or hand off to implementation; do not force a full audit. Stay within the requested surface.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating missing private data as proof of failure.
- Extrapolating one URL to the whole site.
- Reporting rendered behavior from raw source alone.
- Prioritizing metadata before access, indexing, or canonical defects.
- Presenting generic advice without evidence or a completion condition.
