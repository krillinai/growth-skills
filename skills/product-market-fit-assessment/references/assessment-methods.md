# Product-Market Fit Assessment Methods

## Evidence Stack

| Layer | Supportive evidence | False-positive check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Problem | frequent or severe job, costly alternative, workaround, switching behavior | enthusiasm without changed behavior |
| First value | qualified entity reaches a meaningful result with acceptable quality and time to value | onboarding or interface completion only |
| Repeated value | mature value-bearing retention at the natural interval | aggregate activity from new cohorts |
| Declared dependence | qualified must-have response plus reasons | employees, fans, premature users, selected respondents |
| Segment | value, retention, dependence, and economics within a coherent unit | blended company average |
| Organic pull | direct demand, return, referral, customer language, sales pull | attention without activation or retention |
| Economics | willingness to pay, contribution, cost to serve, payback | revenue without churn, discount, or variable cost |
| Distribution | incremental qualified reach and retained channel quality | temporary spike, attribution, or subsidized growth |
| Guardrails | trust, quality, refunds, support, safety, concentration, capacity | growth that transfers cost or harm elsewhere |

Do not average layers. Reconcile them, preserve contradictions, and state which missing item could change the decision.

## Must-Have Survey Check

Before interpreting the very-disappointed rate, verify:

1. Respondents reached the declared core value and had enough time to judge repeated use.
2. The segment, role, use case, source, plan, tenure, and activity are visible.
3. Sample frame, invited N, response N, response rate, field dates, and uncertainty are visible.
4. Employees, internal testers, duplicates, fans without use, and disqualified users are excluded or separately reported.
5. Open-text reasons, alternatives, and strongest negative cases are synthesized.
6. Observed activation, mature retention, expansion, churn, willingness to pay, and economics are compared with the survey.

Calculate only for a qualified supplied sample:

    very disappointed rate
    = qualified respondents selecting very disappointed
      / all qualified respondents who answered

The 40 percent heuristic is not a universal threshold. A result above it does not certify fit; a result below it does not prove absence of a retained segment.

## Retention Check

Require a stable entity, eligibility rule, cohort start, value-bearing event, natural interval, denominator, maturity rule, cutoff, timezone, source version, and decision-relevant segments. Compare mature cohorts at equal age. Keep original retention, resurrection, expansion, revenue, contribution, supply, and demand views separate.

Route matrix construction, right censoring, mix decomposition, or cohort LTV calculation to `cohort-analysis`. Route recurring-value mechanism diagnosis to `retention`.

## Four Fits

Evaluate separately:

- `Market-Product`: important problem, meaningful first value, repeated value, customer explanation, and alternatives;
- `Product-Channel`: product experience, promise, sharing or conversion requirements, and retained quality fit the channel;
- `Channel-Model`: marginal CAC, payback, contribution, sales or conversion cost, saturation, and cash fit the model;
- `Model-Market`: reachable customers, price or ARPU, contribution, retention, attainable share, and timing can support the intended outcome.

One Fit does not imply the others. A conflict is a diagnostic result, not an error to average away.

## Maturity Assignment

| Maturity | Minimum defensible statement | Next constraint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `interest` | a defined group shows a problem, attention, signup, interview, waitlist, or early commercial signal | usable value and qualified first-value evidence |
| `initial value` | qualified entities reach a meaningful first outcome | repeated value in mature compatible cohorts |
| `retained segment` | a named unit repeatedly receives value | declared dependence, economics, distribution, and guardrail reconciliation |
| `viable fit system` | product, market, channel, and model evidence support one bounded operating scope | marginal quality and one adjacent expansion path |
| `adaptive fit` | the team detects degradation, versions claims, and revalidates after material change | preserve learning across scale and change |

Assign the lowest stage consistent with all material evidence. Missing evidence does not equal failure, but it cannot support a higher stage. Contradictory evidence lowers confidence and may lower maturity when it challenges a required condition.

## Decision Rules

Choose one:

- `deepen`: strengthen repeated value in the current retained segment;
- `measure`: instrument or collect the smallest evidence needed for a live decision;
- `scale one mechanism`: expand a bounded channel or loop while monitoring retained quality, economics, and guardrails;
- `test one adjacent unit`: validate one new role, use case, segment, market, product, price, or channel against the original unit;
- `adapt`: change product, promise, onboarding, price, channel, or service hypothesis, then revalidate;
- `narrow`: restrict the claim and operating scope to the unit with coherent evidence;
- `stop`: end a hypothesis when decision rules, harm, economics, or repeated-value evidence make continuation unjustified.

Every plan needs an owner, decision date, evidence source, metric definition, maturity window, guardrails, stop rule, and proof of completion. Do not promise uplift or issue a scale recommendation from interest, one survey, one retention curve, attributed demand, or revenue alone.
