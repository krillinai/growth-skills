# Incentive System Design

Design incentives to remove a specific barrier to real customer or network value, then keep only behavior whose retained incremental contribution exceeds full marginal cost and harm. An incentive can accelerate value discovery or coordination; it cannot manufacture Product-Market Fit, make attributed activity incremental, or turn reward-dependent behavior into retention.

Read [incentive-contract.md](references/incentive-contract.md) before accepting eligibility, behavior, reward, exposure, cost, cohort, or risk evidence. Read [economics-and-incrementality.md](references/economics-and-incrementality.md) before calculating lift, full cost, retained incremental value, payback, cannibalization, or portfolio allocation. Read [mechanism-risk-and-governance.md](references/mechanism-risk-and-governance.md) before selecting reward mechanics, fraud controls, fairness rules, fulfillment, taper, or stop conditions. Read [output-contract.md](references/output-contract.md) before delivery. Use [playbook-sources.md](references/playbook-sources.md) to cite the pinned Growth Playbook basis.

## Select One Mode

| Mode | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `audit` | Evaluate an existing program, result, economics claim, risk system, or retained-value effect |
| `design` | Define a bounded incentive hypothesis, pilot, eligibility, reward, measurement, risk, taper, and stop contract |
| `portfolio` | Compare programs, markets, segments, or reward tiers using marginal retained value, capacity, risk, and strategic dependence |

Name one primary mode, decision, owner, target behavior, customer or network value, eligible population, horizon, budget, and external-action boundary. If private evidence is unavailable, return a public-evidence-bounded hypothesis and measurement plan, not a score or causal claim.

## Freeze The Incentive Contract

Record product, market, lifecycle role, participant sides and entities; value, natural frequency, behavioral barrier, target action, non-incentive alternatives, and counterfactual; eligible and excluded populations; reward type, amount, currency, payer, recipient, timing, visibility, terms, expiration, settlement, reversal, liability, and dispute rules; assignment or eligibility, exposure, action, fulfillment, outcome, identity, deduplication, cohort, window, cutoff, and maturity; organic baseline, holdout, attribution and incrementality basis; full cost, contribution, payback, budget, capacity, and uncertainty; fraud, cannibalization, quality, trust, fairness, accessibility, privacy, compliance, and support; taper, stop, owners, sources, evidence states, and requested external actions.

Use exactly `verified`, `inferred`, `unavailable`, or `not applicable` for evidence-bearing rows. A stakeholder claim without inspectable support may be a `reported signal` with no evidence state. Keep gross response, attributed value, incremental effect, prediction, and scenario assumptions separate.

## Diagnose The Barrier Before The Reward

Test whether the missing behavior reflects undiscovered value, real participant cost, temporary coordination failure, fragile but valuable repetition, referral effort or social risk, or customer-provider misalignment. Preserve alternatives such as weak product value, poor explanation, onboarding failure, low demand frequency, unattractive supplier economics, price mismatch, bad service, or measurement error.

An incentive is most defensible when it removes a temporary barrier to valuable behavior. It is least defensible when the program continually pays participants to tolerate a weak product, shifts organic behavior, or requires increasing reward for the same response.

## Measure Incrementality, Durability, And Economics

Do not treat redemptions, codes, clicks, trips, purchases, invitations, lessons, supply hours, revenue, or K-factor as incremental. Prefer a credible randomized, geographic, switchback, phased, threshold, matched, or time-series counterfactual whose assumptions fit the mechanism. Route assignment, power, interference, and readout details to `experiment-design`.

Measure immediate action lift, value attainment, post-incentive behavior at the natural frequency, retained incremental participants or value, full incremental program cost, net incremental contribution, payback, pull-forward, organic displacement, cross-product or cross-channel movement, fraud, support, complaints, fairness, and trust.

Calculate only from compatible entities, eligibility, exposure, definitions, cohorts, markets, currencies, horizons, maturity, cost boundaries, and sources. Show every formula and prevent overlapping cost or cannibalization categories from being subtracted twice. Use marginal rather than average historical economics for scaling and allocation.

## Design Controls And Taper

Target the smallest segment and transition with one primary behavior. Align the reward with product or network value where possible. Define eligibility before exposure; separate qualification, action, value, settlement, reversal, and appeal; and place controls before eligibility, during action, before fulfillment, and after settlement.

Use capped pilots, budget and exposure limits, quality and contribution floors, fraud reserves, delayed or reversible settlement where appropriate, clear terms, accessibility, complaint and dispute paths, and explicit taper and stop rules. Label incentive exposure before using rewarded behavior in personalization, prediction, or product learning.

Choose one next decision: `measure`, `pilot`, `continue`, `scale bounded segment`, `redesign`, `taper`, or `stop`. Scale only where marginal retained incremental contribution is positive under the declared horizon and quality, fraud, cannibalization, fairness, trust, compliance, and capacity guardrails pass.

## Route Specialist Work

Route pricing, packaging, discounts as commercial architecture, and outcome-based revenue models to `monetization`; referral, content, marketplace, data, or reinvestment loop closure to `growth-loop-design`; activation and recurring-value mechanisms to `activation` and `retention`; cohort construction to `cohort-analysis`; metric contracts to `growth-metrics-design`; tracking implementation to `tracking-plan`; experiment design and readout to `experiment-design`; customer mechanism research to `customer-research`; and broad constraint triage to `growth-diagnosis`.

This Skill owns the incentive mechanism, incremental economics, post-incentive durability, risk, fairness, taper, and portfolio decision. It does not duplicate adjacent workflows or operate live rewards.

## Deliver In Order

Return:

1. mode, decision, owner, target value and behavior, population, horizon, budget, and boundary;
2. barrier, mechanism, counterfactual, and non-incentive alternatives;
3. incentive, eligibility, exposure, fulfillment, reversal, and taper contract;
4. evidence, cohort, quality, attribution, incrementality, and limitation ledger;
5. full cost, retained incremental contribution, payback, cannibalization, and sensitivity analysis;
6. fraud, abuse, fairness, trust, privacy, compliance, support, and incident controls;
7. bounded validation or portfolio allocation plan with decision and stop rules;
8. operating cadence, handoffs, Playbook references, and external-action boundary.

For China work, keep market, language, locale, product surface, participant, identity, payment, withdrawal, settlement, tax, invoice, platform, channel, terms, consent, privacy, fraud, support, dispute, accessibility, and applicable review separate. Do not infer any platform, payment, tax, or regulatory condition from translation or geography alone.

## External-Action Boundary

This Skill creates and reads local artifacts only. Do not access product, CRM, billing, payment, finance, ad, referral, marketplace, risk, support, analytics, experiment, or messaging systems; export production data; create codes; change eligibility, prices, discounts, credits, commissions, entitlements, budgets, or customer state; issue cash or value; block accounts; contact users; launch or stop experiments or programs; publish; send; spend; or deploy without separate task-level authorization and capability review.

## Completion Gate

Confirm that the decision, participants, value, barrier, alternatives, target behavior, eligibility, reward, exposure, counterfactual, cohorts, natural frequency, costs, contribution, payback, fraud, cannibalization, quality, fairness, trust, privacy, support, budget, capacity, taper, stop, owners, and evidence states are explicit; gross response is not called incremental; rewarded behavior is not called retention before removal; full and marginal economics are used without double counting; local marketplace units and recipient value remain visible; model training labels exposure; specialist handoffs stay bounded; Playbook sources are pinned; and no external action occurred.
