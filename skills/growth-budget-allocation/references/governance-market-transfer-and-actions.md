# Governance, Market Transfer, And Actions

## Version The Allocation Record

Record allocation ID, version, mode, state, current approved version, strategy and planning-cycle versions, source cutoff, reconciliation basis, scenarios, gates, decisions, owner, reviewers, approvers, effective period, review, expiry, and superseded record.

For `reallocate`, preserve old resource states, assumptions, formulas, evidence, alternatives, protected floors, risks, decisions, and rationale. Add new evidence and calculate only affected compatible views. Explain every source-to-destination change. Do not rewrite past uncertainty, availability, or outcomes as if they were known.

Refresh after a material strategy, customer, product, market, channel, platform, price, metric, attribution, experiment, retention, cost, cash, funding, capacity, dependency, risk, obligation, approval, or evidence-maturity change. An expired approval or changed accounting basis requires explicit reconciliation.

## Assign Decision Rights

Separate:

- analyst evidence and recommendation;
- accountable portfolio decision owner;
- allocation-unit and protected-obligation owners;
- finance, accounting, treasury, people, procurement, legal or regulatory, privacy, security, customer, product, data, experiment, channel, market, and operating reviewers as applicable;
- budget, headcount, contract, system, customer-exposure, product, publication, or deployment approvers;
- authorized execution owners and independent completion proof.

Preserve segregation of duties. A Skill output cannot approve, authorize, transfer, spend, hire, fire, assign owners, or bind a team.

## Transfer Across Markets

Treat each market as a new allocation and evidence boundary. Re-establish:

- customer, user, buyer, payer, beneficiary, problem, alternatives, value, repeated value, and protections;
- product, language, locale, device, accessibility, integration, delivery, support, reliability, and service obligations;
- channel, platform, app distribution, partner, creator, sales, procurement, reachability, policy, and concentration;
- price, currency, exchange rates, purchasing power, payment, invoice, tax, refunds, contracts, cost, contribution, cash, funding, and working capital;
- identity, consent, data source, storage, transfer, privacy, content, advertising, sector, and applicable review;
- local baseline, target, forecast, evidence, marginal bands, capacity, risks, protected pools, owners, approvals, gates, expiry, stop, rollback, correction, and exit.

Translation, a local language, currency conversion, or headquarters approval does not validate transfer. For China, distinguish market, legal entity, language, locale, product, channel, platform, app distribution, identity, payment, invoice, tax, data, content, advertising, support, source access, costs, staffing, and locally accountable review. Use current direct sources and local expertise. Do not provide legal, tax, accounting, regulatory, provider-availability, approval, causal, or performance conclusions.

## Protect People And Data

Use aggregate, redacted, pseudonymous, minimum-necessary evidence and small-cell suppression. Define purpose, authority, consent where required, access, retention, deletion, audit, lineage, correction, and misuse prevention.

Do not request or expose credentials, payment details, private messages, health or financial information, protected traits, precise locations, raw identities, full customer histories, employee reviews, compensation, ratings, or disciplinary records when allocation can be decided from aggregate evidence.

Do not identify, score, rank, or target individuals for budgets, pricing, service, employment, credit, insurance, housing, health, or similarly consequential decisions. Do not infer sensitive traits, reidentify people, join data beyond the declared purpose, use employee outcomes as ROI, or hide fairness, accessibility, trust, retaliation, and customer harms.

## Prepare External Actions

Create local artifacts and approval-ready requests only. For each proposed external action record:

| Field | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Action | Exact budget, resource, contract, system, customer-exposure, communication, or operating change |
| Scope | Source pool, destination, amount or band, period, owner, affected population, and market |
| Authority | Decision, approvers, authorization, segregation of duties, and effective window |
| Prerequisites | Evidence, maturity, finance, people, procurement, privacy, security, legal or other review |
| Controls | Dry run, reconciliation, cap, monitoring, customer and operating guardrails, stop, rollback, correction, and audit |
| Proof | Authorized executor, immutable record, independent verification, residual obligations, and result boundary |

Do not access authenticated finance, banking, planning, procurement, HR, payroll, advertising, analytics, warehouse, CRM, billing, product, cloud, partner, or communication systems. Do not transfer resources, change headcount, purchase, sign, hire, fire, reorganize, launch, pause, contact, publish, send, spend, procure, deploy, or claim completion.

## Route Specialist Work

| Need | Route |
| --- | --- |
| Arenas, portfolio thesis, classes, exclusions, and medium-term choices | `growth-strategy` |
| One investment decision case | `growth-investment-case` |
| One opportunity estimate | `growth-opportunity-sizing` |
| Channel strategy and channel-only portfolio | `acquisition-strategy` |
| Detailed CAC, LTV, contribution, marginal return, and payback | `unit-economics-analysis`, `ltv-analysis` |
| Attribution, causal evidence, metrics, and maturity | `attribution-analysis`, `experiment-design`, `growth-metrics-design` |
| Time-series outlooks and scenario calibration | `growth-forecasting` |
| Infrastructure, organization, lifecycle, pricing, market, or GTM readiness | the relevant specialist Skill |
| Plan-wide artifacts, capacity, budgets, calendar, and approvals | `growth-planning-cycle` |

Every handoff names its input contract, decision, expected artifact, owner, due or maturity date, dependency, and permission boundary. A handoff does not imply access or execution.
