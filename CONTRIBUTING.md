# Contributing

Growth Skills accepts focused Agent Skills that solve a clear growth or marketing job with an executable workflow, explicit evidence boundaries, inspectable outputs, and realistic evaluation cases.

## Repository Structure

Keep Skill directories flat and independently installable:

```text
skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md
├── agents/openai.yaml
├── evals/evals.json
└── references/
```

Add `scripts/` only for deterministic or repeatedly implemented operations. Add `assets/` only when the Skill directly uses those files in its output. Do not add a README, changelog, installation guide, or other process documentation inside a Skill directory.

## Skill Requirements

- Use a short lowercase hyphenated name that describes the recognizable job.
- Keep YAML frontmatter to `name` and `description` only.
- Make the trigger description specific enough to distinguish adjacent Skills.
- State the primary modes, required inputs, evidence states, outputs, external-action boundary, and completion gate.
- Treat missing private evidence as `unavailable`; do not invent it or penalize its absence.
- Use `China` or `中国` consistently for the market name.
- Keep market, language, locale, platform, account, permissions, data, and current rules separate.
- Pin attributable Growth Playbook sources when the Skill derives material methods from the Playbook.
- Add pressure cases that test missing evidence, incompatible data, market transfer, false precision, authority boundaries, and prohibited external actions.

## Catalog And Status

Every Skill must appear exactly once in `catalog/taxonomy.json` and once in `catalog/skills.json`. New Skills start as `experimental`. Promote a Skill only after its structure, eval specification, and realistic forward tests support the new status.

Update English and Simplified Chinese catalog names and descriptions in `catalog/skills.json`. Do not edit generated README tables directly.

## Validation

Run:

```bash
python3 tooling/generate_readme_catalog.py
python3 tooling/validate_repo.py
```

The validator checks Skill structure, Agent metadata, local references, eval shape and global IDs, catalog coverage, taxonomy, bundles, Playbook revision records, generated README freshness, China terminology, and executable validator tests.

## Pull Requests

Keep one Skill or one collection-level structural change per pull request where practical. Explain the user job, boundary with adjacent Skills, reusable resources, evaluation coverage, Playbook basis, and validation performed.
